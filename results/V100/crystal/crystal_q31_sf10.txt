          The memory access pattern for global stores in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses   
          4.0 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between       
          threads, results in 4.8 sectors per request, or 4.8*32 = 153.0 bytes of cache data transfers per request.     
          The optimal thread address pattern for 4.0 byte accesses would result in 4.0*32 = 128.0 bytes of cache data   
          transfers per request, to maximize L1TEX cache performance. Check the Source Counters section for             
          uncoalesced global stores.

          The memory access pattern for stores from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to  
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.3 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced stores and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory        
          request.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 15.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to    
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          1.01 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.07 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp  
          State Statistics and Source Counters sections.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 5.1 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a 
          L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation. Find the instruction producing the data being waited upon  
          to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory      
          access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing    
          data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently used data to   
          shared memory. This stall type represents about 32.8% of the total average of 15.5 cycles between issuing     
          two instructions.

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 16.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 15.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.

          The memory access pattern for global stores in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses   
          4.0 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between       
          threads, results in 4.8 sectors per request, or 4.8*32 = 154.9 bytes of cache data transfers per request.     
          The optimal thread address pattern for 4.0 byte accesses would result in 4.0*32 = 128.0 bytes of cache data   
          transfers per request, to maximize L1TEX cache performance. Check the Source Counters section for

          The memory access pattern for stores from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to  
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.3 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 7.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          5.90 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.18 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp

          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 16.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 15.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.

          The memory access pattern for global stores in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses   
          4.0 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between       
          threads, results in 9.2 sectors per request, or 9.2*32 = 293.1 bytes of cache data transfers per request.     
          The optimal thread address pattern for 4.0 byte accesses would result in 4.0*32 = 128.0 bytes of cache data   
          transfers per request, to maximize L1TEX cache performance. Check the Source Counters section for             
          uncoalesced global stores.

          The memory access pattern for stores from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to  
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.4 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced stores and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 15.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to    
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          0.97 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.

    OPT   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

          The memory access pattern for global loads in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses    
          5.4 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between       
          threads, results in 7.6 sectors per request, or 7.6*32 = 244.4 bytes of cache data transfers per request.     
          The optimal thread address pattern for 5.4 byte accesses would result in 5.4*32 = 173.8 bytes of cache data   
          transfers per request, to maximize L1TEX cache performance. Check the Source Counters section for

          The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to

          The memory access pattern for stores from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 5.5 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          14.64 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.35 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps   
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 49.5 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on  
          a L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation. Find the instruction producing the data being waited     
          upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the        
          memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by        
          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently     
          used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 61.6% of the total average of 80.3 cycles        
          between issuing two instructions.

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 18.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 16.5 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.
